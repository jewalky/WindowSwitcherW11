# WindowSwitchW11

A quick and dirty Alt+Tab replacement that works like the classic one from WinNT, as 24H2 removed the ability to reg-patch this.

Note: might not be good for reuse, since parts of the code are written by AI (specifically the parts that interact with WinAPI). MIT license for the same reason.
